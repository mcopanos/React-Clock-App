# US Time Zone Clock App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This app displays the different time zones in US from eastern to pacific time, central and mountain time. Using the [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) library I was able to format the different time zones. I had an idea for this app while working and taking calls from customers in different time zones. This was a good project to show off Reacts code re-useablity. To use this app make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and clone the project and run the following script.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
